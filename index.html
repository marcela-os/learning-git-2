        <p>All around me are familiar faces<br>
          Worn out places, worn out faces<br>
          Bright and early for their daily races<br>
          Going nowhere, going nowhere<br>
          Their tears are filling up their glasses<br>
          No expression, no expression<br>
          Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow<br>
          No tomorrow, no tomorrow</p>
        <p>And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad<br>
          The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had<br>
          I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take<br>
          When people run in circles it's a very very<br>
          Mad world, mad world</p>
        <p>Children waiting for the day, they feel good<br>
          Happy birthday, happy birthday<br>
          Made to feel the way that every child should<br>
          Sit and listen, sit and listen<br>
          Went to school and I was very nervous<br>
          No one knew me, no one knew me<br>
          Hello teacher, tellâ€¦</p>
